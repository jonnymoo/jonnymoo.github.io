  <h1>The Electro-Library</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>The words on the printed surface are taken in by seeing, not by hearing.</li>
    <li>One communicates meanings through the convention of words; meaning attains form through letters.</li>
    <li>Economy of expression: optics not phonetics.</li>
    <li>The design of the book-space, set according to the constraints of printing mechanics, must correspond to the tensions and pressures of content.</li>
    <li>The design of the book-space using process blocks which issue from the new optics. The supernatural reality of the perfected eye.</li>
    <li>The continuous sequence of pages: the bioscopic book.</li>
    <li>The new book demands the new writer. Inkpot and quill-pen are dead.</li>
    <li>The printed surface transcends space and time. The printed surface, the infinity of books, must be transcended. THE ELECTRO-LIBRARY.</li>
