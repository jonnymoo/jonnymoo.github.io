# Brython

Blown away with what I can hosted straight out of GitHub and with no server element required at all (beyond what GitHub provides with Jekyll)

_Todo_ send a tweet of appreciation.

The [GitHub page](https://github.com/brython-dev/brython/graphs/contributors) is led by [Pierre Quentel](https://github.com/PierreQuentel) and has quite a healthy conversation on [its google groups](https://groups.google.com/g/brython) 

_Todo_ read the [contributing](https://github.com/brython-dev/brython/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) pages and think what I can do to get involved
