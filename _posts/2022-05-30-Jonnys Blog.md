Most good things are built on the greatness of others. I'm starting this as my own diary. It is partly aide memoir, partly as a reflective learning exercise.

The pages are hosted in GitHub and I've used a jekyll project I worked on for the [Bradford Coder Dojo](https://bradford-coderdojo.github.io/) as the starting point and stripped it down. The design was started as simple as possible using the Jeremy Thomas's [Web Design in 4 minutes](https://jgthms.com/web-design-in-4-minutes/) and then made professional and functional by [Wetgenes](https://wetgenes.com/welcome)'s insanely talented Shi.
