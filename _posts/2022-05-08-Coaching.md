# Coaching

Two months into a coaching professional apprenticeship.

Not progressing as I would expect so let's do a bit of research.

The Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education [page for Coaching Professional level 5](https://www.instituteforapprenticeships.org/apprenticeship-standards/coaching-professional-v1-0)

My course is with [Linden Management](https://www.lindenmanagement.org.uk/). I can't find any detailed information about the qualification. _Todo_: Chase this next week. Assume I'm not looking in the right place.

Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education are a non-departmental public body, sponsored by the Department for Education. Not sure exactly what this means. I presume it means they are independent of direct government policy, they have their own board. _Todo_: Find out why Linden are not on the [institutes list of providers](https://findapprenticeshiptraining.apprenticeships.education.gov.uk/courses/555/providers). 

Their pages splits the apprenticeship into "duties" and cross references to knowledge, skills and behaviours.

# Occupation detail - Todo list

Occupation detail. _Todo_: Go through the institutes page and pick out definitions and links for further reading.

There are 9 duties. _Todo_: pick through and relate back to my course.
