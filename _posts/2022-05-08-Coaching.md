## Coaching

Two months into a coaching professional apprenticeship.

Not progressing as I would expect so let's do a bit of research.

The Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education [page for Coaching Professional level 5](https://www.instituteforapprenticeships.org/apprenticeship-standards/coaching-professional-v1-0)

My course is with [Linden Management](https://www.lindenmanagement.org.uk/). 

Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education are a non-departmental public body, sponsored by the Department for Education. Not sure exactly what this means. I presume it means they are independent of direct government policy, they have their own board.

Their pages splits the apprenticeship into "duties" and cross references to knowledge, skills and behaviours.
