First lesson up and live.

It uses the a simple layout which puts an [ACE editor](https://ace.c9.io/) next to a textarea styled as a console output.

I'm using the [brython](https://brython.info/) implementation of python to interpret and run the code from the editor and pipe the output to the "console" textarea.
