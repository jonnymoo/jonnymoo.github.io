title: Sustainable Transformation
---
I have been working in digital transformation for years. Digital Transformation At Scale (Greenway Terrett Bracken Loosemore, 2021) define digital transformation as:

"A successful digital transformation makes it possible not only to deliver products and services that are simpler, cheaper, and better, but for the organisation as a whole to operate effectively in the online era."

The (European Digital SME Alliance) define [Sustainable Digitalisation](https://www.digitalsme.eu/what-is-sustainable-digitalisation/) as "Strengthening Europeâ€™s digital sovereignty by enabling the twin transitions of our economy"

Net Zero by 2050 means cutting our carbon emissions by 90%.

Sustainable Futures Software Vision:
"Provide transformations which cut emissions in line with Net Zero by making products and services simpler, cheaper, and better, while enabling organisations to operate more effectively".
